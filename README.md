# re-classify Tool

The `re-classify` tool is a command-line utility that classifies tokens using on
a configuration file based on regular expression patterns. It is designed to
implement Monogram's stripped down external classification protocol, in which
tokens are read, one per line, from the standard input and their 1-line
classification is written to the standard output.

**Useful tips**: The number of output lines will always match the number
of input lines. You will need to provide the whole of the input before any
output is generated.

This project uses [Just](https://github.com/casey/just) as a command runner. To see available commands:

```bash
just
```

Common commands:
```bash
just build      # Build the binary

## Usage

The `re-classify` command takes a single argument, which is the name of a
configuration file, whose format is described below.

```bash
re-classify [OPTIONS] FILE < STDIN > STDOUT
```

The tool reads tokens from standard input, **one token per line**, and outputs a
single classification character for each token to the standard output.

The ony supported options are `--help` and `--check`. The `--check` option
verifies the syntax of the configuration file and exits.


## Classification Protocol

The tool outputs 1-line classifications for each token. These consist of
a single letter optionally followed by additional, whitespace-separated data.
The 1-letter codes are:

- `S` - Start token (form start, e.g., `def`, `if`, `while`)
- `E` - End token (form end, e.g., `end`, `endif`, `endwhile`)
- `C` - Compound token (multi-part constructs)
- `L` - Label token (identifiers used as labels)
- `P` - Prefix token (operators that come before their operand)
- `O` - Operator token (infix, postfix operators)
- `V` - Variable token (default for unclassified identifiers)

For start tokens, the output may include expected end tokens:
- `S enddef endfunction` - Start token with possible endings

## Configuration File Format

The configuration file is in YAML format with the following structure:

### Basic Structure

```yaml
surround-regexp:
  - start: "start_pattern"
    endings: ["end_pattern_1", "end_pattern_2"]
  - start: "another_pattern"
    end: "single_end_pattern"

form-prefix-regexp:
  - "prefix_pattern"

simple-label-regexp:
  - "label_pattern"

compound-label-regexp:
  - "compound_pattern"

operator-regexp:
  - pattern: "operator_pattern"
    prefix-prec: 100
    infix-prec: 50
    postfix-prec: 75
```

### Pattern Types

#### 1. Surround Patterns (`surround-regexp`)

Surround patterns have three components, namely:

- `start`, which is a single regular expression, which must match the whole
  of a token's text. Required.
- `endings`, which is a list of substitutions, where $0 is replaced by the
  whole of the token's text and $1, $2, etc by any captured group. To generate
  a `$` use `$$`.
- `end`, which is a single regular expression, which must match the whole of a
  token's text. Optional - although one of `endings` and `end` must be present.

The rules for using these components are as follows:

1. If a token matches the `start` expression in full then it is considered a
   form-start. 
2. If `endings` is present, then triggered by a match of a start token, all the
   substitutions are generated and these are the matching form-end for that
   start token.
3. If `end` is present, then any token matching the `end` expression in 
   full is additionally considered to be a form-end token. 
    - When `endings` are missing, then _in addition_ all of these tokens 
      are considered to be the form-end for the corresponding form-start.
    - When `endings` are present, then _only_ the generated tokens are
      considered pairs i.e. `endings` refines the pairing relationship.
4. When `end` is missing, `endings` are required and an attempt is made to
   synthesize the `end` from the endings. This can be done when the 
   substitutions are either constant or only include $0 and not $1, $2, ...
    - If the substitution text includes $N, where N != 1, re-classify
      will fail with an error.



Here is a simplified example, where `def` is matched with `enddef` or `end`;
`if` and `while` are matched with `endif`/`if_end` and `endwhile`/`white_end`
respectively, and `begin` is matched with `end`.
```yaml
surround-regexp:
  - start: "def"
    endings: ["enddef", "end"]
  - start: "if|while"
    endings: ["end$0", "$0_end"]  # $0 substitutes the matched text
  - start: "begin"
    end: "end"  # Single end pattern (alternative to endings array)
```

#### 2. Form Prefix Patterns (`form-prefix-regexp`)

This introduces a list of regexs for identifying form-prefixes.

```yaml
form-prefix-regexp:
  - "not"
  - "\\+"  # Literal + character
```

#### 3. Simple Label Patterns (`simple-label-regexp`)

This introduces a list of regexs for identifying simple labels:

```yaml
simple-label-regexp:
  - "[a-z]+:"
  - "label[0-9]+"
```

#### 4. Compound Label Patterns (`compound-label-regexp`)

This introduces a list of regexs for identifying compound labels:

```yaml
compound-label-regexp:
  - "elseif"
  - "[a-z]+__[a-z]+"
```

#### 5. Operator Patterns (`operator-regexp`)

Operators with precedence values for prefix, infix, and postfix positions:

```yaml
operator-regexp:
  - pattern: "="
    prefix-prec: 0
    infix-prec: 1
    postfix-prec: 0
  - pattern: "\\+\\+"
    prefix-prec: 100
    infix-prec: 0
    postfix-prec: 75
```


## Example

In this simple example we pair `if`/`fi` together and `while`/`done` together
and make `do` a simple label.

### Configuration

```yaml
surround-regexp:
  - start: if
    endings: fi
  - start: while
    endings: done

simple-label-regexp:
  - do
```

### Testing

Create a simple test with the existing test configuration (one token per line):

```bash
printf "if\nvariable\nendif\n" | re-classify config.yaml
```

Expected output:
```txt
S endif if_end
V
E
```

This shows:
- `if` classified as Start token (`S`) with expected endings `endif` and `if_end`
- `variable` classified as Variable (`V`)  
- `endif` classified as End token (`E`)
